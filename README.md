# London Energy Consumption Prediction

##  Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning solution to predict daily electrical consumption for customers across London boroughs. By integrating historical weather data with energy consumption patterns, we provide actionable insights for energy companies to optimize resource allocation, improve grid stability, and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Business Problem
Energy companies face significant challenges in predicting demand patterns, leading to:
- **Inefficient resource allocation** - Over/under-supply scenarios
- **Potential supply shortages** during peak demand periods
- **Increased operational costs** due to poor forecasting
- **Grid instability** from unexpected demand spikes

## 🏗️ Project Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Data Acquisition & Loading
- **Weather Data**: London daily weather records (1979-2021) from Kaggle
- **Energy Data**: London hourly energy consumption (2011-2014) from Kaggle
- Automated data validation and quality checks

### Stage 2: Feature Engineering
- **Temporal Features**: Extract year, month, day, season components
- **Weather Derivatives**: Temperature ranges, lag features, rolling averages
- **Energy Patterns**: Day-of-week indicators, consumption trends
- **Geographic Features**: Borough-specific indicators

### Stage 3: Advanced Data Imputation
- **Challenge**: Significant missing cloud cover data (pre-1990s)
- **Solution**: Deep Learning Classification Model
- **Architecture**: Residual neural network with GELU activations
- **Performance**: 27% accuracy (above random chance for 10-class problem)

### Stage 4: Predictive Model Development
- **Model Architecture**: Deep Learning Regression Network
- **Input Layer**: 54 engineered features
- **Hidden Layers**: 3 residual blocks with inverted bottlenecks
- **Training**: Adam optimizer with cosine decay learning rate
- **Validation**: 80/20 train-test split with early stopping

### Stage 5: Model Evaluation & Business Intelligence
- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAPE, R² Score
- **Feature Importance**: Permutation importance analysis
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps, time series analysis, prediction plots
- **Business Insights**: Operational recommendations and seasonal planning
