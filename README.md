Exploring London Energy data from Kaggle - Consumption Prediction

Project Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive data science solution for a fictional London energy company, aiming to accurately predict the daily total electrical consumption of their customers across different boroughs. By integrating and analyzing historical weather patterns with energy consumption data, this initiative provides crucial insights for optimizing energy distribution, resource management, and strategic planning.

Problem Statement
Accurate forecasting of electrical consumption is vital for energy companies to ensure grid stability, manage supply and demand efficiently, and reduce operational costs. Without robust predictive models, challenges such as over-procurement, potential shortages, and inefficient resource allocation can arise. This project addresses these needs by building a data-driven predictive capability.

Data Sources
This project leverages two primary datasets, sourced from Kaggle and adapted for this analysis:

London Daily Weather (1979-2021): Provides historical meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, sunshine, etc.) crucial for understanding environmental impacts on energy demand.

Kaggle Source

London Hourly Energy Dataset (2011-2014): Contains detailed hourly energy consumption records for various London homes, including borough information.

Kaggle Source

Methodology
The project follows a structured data science pipeline:

Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:

Loading and merging the weather and energy datasets.

Feature engineering from date/time columns (e.g., extracting year, month, day).

Initial handling of missing values and data type conversions.

Advanced Missing Data Imputation (cloud_cover):

Identified significant missing data in the cloud_cover column.

Implemented a deep learning classification model to impute these missing values. This approach retains valuable historical data and leverages complex relationships with other weather variables for more accurate imputation than simpler methods.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

In-depth visualization and statistical analysis of weather patterns and energy consumption trends.

Correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables (e.g., temperature vs. energy).

Time-series analysis to identify seasonal and annual patterns.

Feature Engineering:

Creation of additional features to enhance model performance (e.g., lagged variables, rolling averages, holiday indicators).

Predictive Model Development:

Development of a suitable machine learning regression model to predict daily total electrical consumption per borough. (Details on specific model type would go here if known, e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Model Evaluation:

Rigorous evaluation of the predictive model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE, R-squared) to ensure reliability and accuracy.

Insights & Communication:

Translating technical findings into actionable business insights, specifically tailored for a non-technical executive audience (the fictional CEO).

Technical Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

numpy for numerical operations.

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

scikit-learn for machine learning utilities (preprocessing, model evaluation).

keras (or tensorflow.keras) for building and training the deep learning imputation model.

(Potentially other ML libraries based on final predictive model choice).

How to Run This Project
To run this notebook and reproduce the analysis:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/A-Monaghan/LondonEnergy.git
cd LondonEnergy
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt # (You'll need to create this file based on your imports)
A requirements.txt file is essential. You can generate one using pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing all necessary libraries.

Download Datasets:

Manually download london_weather.csv and london_homes_energy.csv from the Kaggle links provided in the "Data Sources" section.

Place them into a data/raw/ directory within your cloned repository (you might need to create this folder).

Alternatively, set up the Kaggle API as described in the Python Kaggle library documentation for direct download via code.


Future Enhancements
Expanded Feature Engineering: Explore more complex features like public holidays, school terms, or economic indicators.

Time Series Modeling: Implement advanced time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTMs) for forecasting.

Borough-Specific Models: Develop and compare models tailored to individual boroughs, considering their unique characteristics.

Interactive Dashboard: Create a user-friendly dashboard (e.g., with Dash or Streamlit) to visualize predictions and key drivers.

Model Deployment: Explore options for deploying the trained model as an API for real-time predictions.
